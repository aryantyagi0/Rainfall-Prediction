# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the amount of rainfall using historical weather data through machine learning models. It is built using Python and trained on real-world datasets. A Streamlit interface is also included for user-friendly interaction with the model.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts rainfall based on key weather attributes
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Trained using Random Forest Regressor
- Visualizations for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Streamlit web interface for live predictions
- Evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, R² Score

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interface:** Streamlit
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset includes features such as:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Pressure
  - and others…
- Target: **Rainfall Amount (mm)**
- Data was cleaned, normalized, and checked for missing values before training.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed EDA to understand:
- Distribution of rainfall
- Correlation between weather variables
- Missing data patterns
- Seasonal variations in rainfall

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- Model Used: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Reason: Performs well on tabular data, handles non-linearity, and reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Web App

An interactive web app is deployed using Streamlit where users can input weather features and get predicted rainfall.

---

 Future Improvements
Include more weather features (e.g., cloud cover, dew point)

Hyperparameter tuning for better performance

Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
